This repository contains a **Jenkins Shared Library** that provides reusable components like steps, functions, and pipeline templates to be used across multiple Jenkins pipelines.

---

## 📚 What are Jenkins Shared Libraries?

**Jenkins Shared Libraries** are a way to organize and reuse common pipeline code across different projects.  
Instead of repeating Groovy scripts or steps in every `Jenkinsfile`, you can store them here — making pipelines more **modular**, **maintainable**, and **scalable**.

They allow you to:
- Define reusable **vars** (custom steps)
- Create **global functions**
- Share **pipeline templates**
- Maintain **standardization** across projects

---

## 🌟 Real-World Use Cases

- **Large Teams:** Centralize all pipeline best practices in one place.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Share common deployment logic across services.
- **Enterprise Jenkins Setups:** Manage thousands of jobs using shared building blocks.
- **CI/CD Best Practices:** Ensure security checks, build steps, and deployments are standardized.

## 🔗 Where Is This Shared Library Used?

This shared library is currently being used in the following project:

> [Java Maven CI/CD Application Repository](https://github.com/YashPatil1609/Java-Maven-App)

*(Please replace the above link with your actual project repository link.)*

In that project, the shared library provides:
- Reusable build and deploy functions
- Version increment automation
- Docker image build and push steps
- Clean and modular Jenkins pipeline structure

---

## 📢 Why Use Shared Libraries?

- 💡 **DRY Principle:** Don't Repeat Yourself!  
- 🧹 **Cleaner Pipelines:** Minimal logic inside Jenkinsfiles.  
- ⚡ **Faster Onboarding:** New developers can use ready-made steps easily.  
- 🔥 **Easier Maintenance:** Fix a bug once in the library, and it's fixed across all pipelines.
